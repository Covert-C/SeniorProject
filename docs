	This idea will definitely take some more research and learning on my part but I want to automatically pull information on stocks. I would like to pull information like the actions important people have taken on certain stocks and how the price changes through certain periods of time. I was having a hard time coming up with an idea until my brother and I discussed our investments into gamestop (unfortunately we didn’t make any money but we got out before it fell). We thought it would be interesting to automatically pull all kinds of information that would help us make decisions involving our investments. When my brother turned 10 he got a set amount of money from my father to start investing in small amounts. I received the same amount when I turned 10 and we have been interested in investing ever since even if we don’t invest much. We love doing research into stocks but it would be easier if it was automatically pulled for our use.
	When it comes to implementing this project I would like to use python. I have taken online classes in this language and feel like I am the most experienced in it. It will take some additional knowledge that I will have to investigate into but I believe I can accomplish it.
